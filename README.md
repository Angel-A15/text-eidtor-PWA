# text-eidtor-PWA

## Project
As a developer, I want an application that creates notes and code snippets with 
or without internet connection. I make notes on a regular daily bases for iam increasing
my understanding of new concepts in programming languages. It would be a great loss if I 
were to lose connection to the internet one day. This application would make note 
taking accessible to me anytime and anywhere.

The concept I have set out for the application follows:

  * Javascript files will be bundled by using Webpack
  * Opening the text editor invokes IndexedDB to create a database storage
  * Entering content and clicking off the DOM window will save the content
  * Reopening the text editor after closing will retrieve content from the IndexedDB
  * Clicking the install button will add the application to my desktop as an icon
  * Loading the web application will have a registered service worker using Workbox
  * Registering a service worker should have the static assets preached upon 
  loading along with subsequent pages
  * Deploying to Heroku should have proper scripts for a webpack application
